## Rate limit

Our website uses a rate limiting system to manage traffic. Each user can make up to 2 requests per second. However, there's a flexibility for short bursts of traffic, allowing up to 30 requests at once. If this limit is exceeded, additional requests will be temporarily blocked until the rate limit resets in the next second. This system helps to keep our website stable and responsive for everyone.

## Crowdsec

This system is powered by Crowdsec (Blocklist mirror) more information can be found [here](https://docs.crowdsec.net/u/bouncers/blocklist-mirror).
